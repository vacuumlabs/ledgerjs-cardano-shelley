## [6.0.0](TBD) - [TBD]

Support for CIP0036 voting

### Added

- export of CIP36 vote keys (1694'/1815'/...)
- support for CIP36 voting (signing of vote-cast fragments with 1694 vote keys)
- support for CIP36 features (vote key registration in transaction auxiliary data)

### Changed

- API for Catalyst voting registration (it is still possible to use CIP-0015 in auxiliary data)


## [5.1.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0) - [September 9th 2022]

Support for Babbage era

### Added

- support for new Babbage transaction body elements (total collateral, collateral return output, reference inputs)
- support for post\_alonzo\_transaction_output (as described in https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-ledger/blob/master/eras/babbage/test-suite/cddl-files/babbage.cddl)

### Fixed

- do not provide an unnecessary witness for stake registration certificate (the path in the certificate is shown to the user, but a witness for the path is no longer asked from the Cardano Ledger app; if you want it, add the path to `SignTransactionRequest.additionalWitnessPaths`)


## [5.0.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v4.0.0...v5.0.0) - [March 31st 2022]

Support for Alonzo era (Plutus scripts)

### Added

- support for all new Alonzo transaction elements
- support for stake credentials given by key hash
- a new transaction signing mode for Plutus transactions
- compatibility with Cardano Ledger app v4.0.0

### Changed

- KeyStakeCredentialParams type replaced by KeyPathStakeCredentialParams, KeyHashStakeCredentialParams added
- several items related to hex strings in exported types have been renamed


## [4.0.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v3.2.1...v4.0.0) - [October 27th 2021]

Support for script elements in transactions and addresses.

### Added

- support for address types with script hashes (all Shelley address types are now supported)
- support for script elements in transactions via a new `TransactionSigningMode.MULTISIG_TRANSACTION`
- support for mint field in transaction body
- native script hash derivation call
- validation of canonical ordering of cbor map keys compliant with [CIP 21](https://cips.cardano.org/cips/cip21) (withdrawals, token policy ids in outputs and mint, asset names within an asset group)

### Changed

- API changes: replacing paths with stake credentials in various address and transaction parameters breaks compatibility


## [3.2.1](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v3.2.0...v3.2.1) - [June 9th 2021]

Patch update removing the requirement to order token bundle canonically.

### Removed

- Temporarily remove asset groups canonical ordering validation: https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/111

## [3.2.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v3.1.0...v3.2.0) - [May 24th 2021]

Added support for signing pool registration certificates as operator, support for pool retirement certificates within the `signTransaction()` call and added a new call for operational ceritificate signing - `signOperationalCertificate()`.

### Added

- `TransactionSigningMode.POOL_REGISTRATION_AS_OPERATOR` to allow signing pool registration as operator
- `CertificateType.STAKE_POOL_RETIREMENT`
- `signOperationalCertificate()` call

### Changed

- `PoolRegistrationParams.poolKey` has been changed from a `string` to `PoolKey` in order to support pool operator signing - `poolKey` can now also be sent as a path
- `PoolRegistrationParams.rewardAccount` has been changeed from a `string` to `PoolRewardAccount` in order to support pool operator signing - `rewardAccount` can now also be sent as path
- `AssetGroup.tokens` and `TxOutput.tokenBundle` are required to be in CBOR canonical order


## [3.1.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v3.0.0...v3.1.0) - [May 11th 2021]

Added support for Catalyst voting registration metadata creation within the `signTransaction()` call, introduced in Ledger Cardano app version 2.3.2.

### Added

- automatically generated flow types from typescript source: https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/102

### Changed

- added Catalyst voting registration support: https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/99
- relaxed validation of `signTransaction()` call `ttl` and `validityIntervalStart` parameter to allow zero value
- `AddressParamsReward` now requires staking key path as the `stakingPath` property instead of `spendingPath` (which was misleading)

### Fixed

- validation of zero numerical values, previously the library was incorrectly failing for any zero value passed


## [3.0.0](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v2.2.1...v3.0.0) - [April 13th 2021]

Major release. Switched from flow to TypeScript.

### Changed

- All API calls now use single structured argument instead of long list of partial arguments.
  (For the overview see `src/Ada.ts` changes in https://github.com/vacuumlabs/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/pull/61)
- `AddressTypeNibble` enum renamed to `AddressType`
- `derive/showAddress` now take `network` as an explicit parameter instead of `networkIdOrProtocolMagic` field in `AddressParams`
- all 64-bit integers that were previously stored in fields ending with `Str` (e.g. `feeStr`) are now without the suffix (i.e. `fee`) and take a "bignumber-like" argument which can be `Number` (if it is small enough, i.e. `<= Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), string, or native `BigInt`. Non-native bigint implementations are not supported and should be converted to strings)
- all "tagged enums" now use `{type: SomeType.Variant, params: SomeTypeVariantParams}` typing. This unified previously mixed tagging with sometimes arbitrarily variant fields into the parent type. As part of this change
  - Relays are now typed properly with variants
  - TxOutput was separated into "amount" part (amount & tokenBundle) & `destination` specification.
    - Destination is now explicitly of type `DestinationType.ThirdParty` or `DestinationType.DeviceOwned` to clarify what the device should sign
    - Device owned destination reuses existing `Address` param type
  - `Address` is now tagged enum across different address types (Byron, Base, Enterprise, Pointer, Reward). Reward address still uses `spendingPath` instead of `stakingPath` to denote that this key can be used to spend funds
- All API call types now use `*Request`/`*Response` nomenclature
- GetVersion call now returns `{version, compatibility}` instead of `version` where `compatibility` describes overall set of features we support for the device. It should be responsibility of API users to check `compatibility.isCompatible` flag and urge users to upgrade device to `compatibility.recommendedVersion` if the device is not compatible.
- All (expected) errors thrown by the API are now descendants of `ErrorBase` from `errors` subpackage. API now distinguishes between these error types
  - `InvalidData` - you passed some wrong data to the API. We will not even try to communicate with the device
  - `DeviceUnsupported` - thrown when trying to use API with unsopported Ledger app version (or when using features not yet available for the app version)
  - `DeviceStatusError` - thrown when device rejects operation for some reason. Common reasons are found in `DeviceStatusCodes` mapping.
- There is new documentation available at (https://vacuumlabs.github.io/ledgerjs-cardano-shelley/index.html)

### Removed

- Compatibility with pre-Mary (<2.2) App versions.


## [2.2.1](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/ledgerjs-hw-app-cardano/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1) - [February 18th 2021]
